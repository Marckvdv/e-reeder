# E-Reeder -- A very simple epub reader

## Usage
Clone this repository and open `index.html` with your browser of choice.

## Working
* 'Normal' epub reading
* Per page stylesheets
* Images, fonts, etc.
* Page controls

## Not working
* Epub with internal paths containg `../` as this is not handled (correctly) by JSZip
